# Set this value to false to disable debug mode and do not send debug messages to the console.

# When this option is true, nms will be used for item loading and opening shops
use-nms: true
# The benefit of using NMS is that test results prove that it is almost twice as fast for loading items/opening shops
# The plugin is always tested using NMS and so you should not need to disable this option
# The only reason why you would want to disable this is if you're experiencing version compatibility issues or if support tells you to do so

# https://wiki.gpplugins.com/economyshopgui/file-configuration/sections.yml#specific-currency

# The formatted names for currency's
# Any currency's from gems-economy and ultra-economy will use the default currency formats,

sold-items-ignored-NBTtags:

#-----------------------------------------------Commands------------------------------------------------

# When this option is turned on it will automatically override the essential's sell command with an alias to /sellall.
# There are a few reasons why this setting is turned on for default, and you should use /sellall instead of /sell
# 1. EconomyShopGUI's /sellall command is capable of differentiating item meta data whereas the /sell command from essentials sells items according to their material
# 2. Players accidentally use /sell instead of /sellall ending up in giving them a different sell price for the item
override-sell-command: true
# Note: Disabling this feature will get rid of the command alias, but you will need to restart your server to see changes

# This setting will enable the use of the old /sellall command
# Meaning that if the below setting is set to true, players can use '/sellall' without a subcommand to sell the whole inventory instead of '/sellall inventory'
old-sellall-command: false
# This setting is set to false by default because it may confuse players with the /sell command from essentials, ending in them accidentally selling their whole inventory
